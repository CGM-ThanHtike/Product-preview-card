**"Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge."**

- This is my second challenge here.Implemented with pure html css.
- I used css variables for font sizes and colors for code flexibility.
- Grid for main layout and flex for some components.
- This time, I'm going with mobile first approach.
- "If you have any suggestions or feedback for my code, please feel free to comment."
  **I would greatly appreciate all feedback.**
